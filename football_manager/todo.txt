TODO:

1.  Make the league table sortable on different criteria 
    (tablesorter.com)

2.  Style the league table. 
    www.premierleague.com/en-gb/matchday/league-table.html looks nice.
    
3.  Rename teams app to football.

4.  Add css.

5.  Add form. Include a form for the last 6 matches e.g. WWWLWD

6.  Include a rating for home and away team on Match. This would allow
    a historical view of the rating. Would need updating in the update
    view.
