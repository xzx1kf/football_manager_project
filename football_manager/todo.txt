TODO:

From the league table click on a team and view all the previous matches. 

Make the league table sortable on different criteria (tablesorter.com)

Sort the links out so that the league is at /league and not /teams/league.
The same goes for update. 

The import needs to check for duplicate matches. 

Style the league table. www.premierleague.com/en-gb/matchday/league-table.html
looks nice.
