TODO:

1.  From the league table click on a team and view all the previous 
    matches. 

2.  Make the league table sortable on different criteria 
    (tablesorter.com)

3.  Sort the links out so that the league is at /league and not 
    /teams/league.The same goes for update. 

4.  Style the league table. 
    www.premierleague.com/en-gb/matchday/league-table.html looks nice.
    
5.  Rename teams app to football.
